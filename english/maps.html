                            </h1>
                            Competitive map created for the "Beneath the Dust" 2015 mapping constest. 
                            <p>
                                Almost completely underground, <i>Occult</i> consists of 3 different areas connected with each other through tunnels. A clandestine weapons market, a secret monastery and a sewer system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <i>Occult</i> had the objective of being a competitively viable map. I was tested with multiple different players in competitive play to correct all bugs and polish all game mechanics possible. It's one of my biggest and proudest projects so far.
                            </p>

Set on a space station somewhere in the universe...<p><i>Station</i> Station is a small map that can be played to train with bots or for multiplayer team deathmatch. Almost all textures are custom made.</p><p>It served as an experiment to test the popularity of 'aim' maps vs. regular maps.</p>

                            My most recent project. The goal is to make a japanese aesthetic map that is also viable for competitive play.

                            There's not much information about <i>Shining</i> yet because of its early stages of development.
